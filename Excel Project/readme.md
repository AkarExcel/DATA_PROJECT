## Rion Company â€“ HR Attrition Analysis
ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition at Rion Company, a mid-sized firm seeking to improve employee retention. Using a dataset of 780 employees with 10 key features (demographics, performance, satisfaction, salary, etc.), the analysis identifies critical patterns, correlations, and department-specific insights.
The goal is to provide actionable strategies that help HR and management reduce turnover, boost satisfaction, and strengthen workforce performance.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Primary Goal:
Identify factors contributing to employee attrition and deliver data-driven recommendations to support retention strategies.

### ðŸ—‚ Dataset Summary
The dataset includes the following columns:
â€¢	EmployeeID: Unique employee identifier
â€¢	Age: Age of employee
â€¢	Gender: Male/Female
â€¢	Department: Department of employment (e.g., IT, HR, Sales)
â€¢	Job Role: Specific role within the department
â€¢	Years of Service: Duration of employment
â€¢	Performance Rating: Rated on a 0â€“10 scale
â€¢	Satisfaction Score: Rated on a 0â€“5 scale
â€¢	Salary: Current salary
â€¢	Attrition: Status (Yes/No)

###  ðŸ§ª Methodology
This project follows the PPDAC framework:
â€¢	Problem: Why are employees leaving Rion?
â€¢	Plan: Clean data using Excel, identify quality issues, and analyze using correlation, grouping, and pivot tools.
â€¢	Data: HR dataset with 780 records.
â€¢	Analysis: Identify high-attrition groups, correlations between salary, performance, and attrition, department-based trends.
â€¢	Conclusion: Derive insights and suggest actionable HR interventions.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
â€¢	Salary & Attrition: A strong negative correlation (-0.8) between average salary and attrition.
â€¢	Age Group 31â€“35: Highest attrition occurs here; also one of the lowest-paid groups.
â€¢	Gender Disparity: While overall gap is small (53% male, 47% female), some departments show high gender-specific attrition.
â€¢	Departmental Satisfaction: Engineering has highest satisfaction (4.03) and lowest attrition; HR has lowest satisfaction (3.68) and high attrition.
â€¢	Performance Link: Employees with lower performance scores are more likely to leave.
â€¢	Tenure Insight: Longer service and high performance strongly reduce attrition.

### âœ… Recommendations
1.	Adjust salaries for the 31â€“35 age group to reduce turnover.
2.	Investigate and address gender-specific attrition patterns by department.
3.	Replicate successful strategies from the Engineering department across others.
